I am a research assistant in the [MadS&P](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) research group and advised by [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org/). My research interests are centered around building more secure and trustworthy Machine Learning models. More specifically, my interests focus on foundation models and how they can securely interact with systems.
