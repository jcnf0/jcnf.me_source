abstract: "We introduce a user-centered method to capture design structures---data, marks, and their relationships---from graphics. This approach employs minimal user interaction, involving freeform strokes, and is expressive for a wide variety of graphics (e.g., historical, artistic, and computer-generated). An implementation of this method called DESCRIPT demonstrates the iterative process to progressively construct an intermediary pivot format between the representation and the structure by deriving a set of properties from each drawing stroke. The pivot format enables various generations: a data table for visual inspection and export, standard graphics for visual analysis, and graphical re-styling using generative models. We extensively illustrate with various examples and discuss how the method paves the way for a new generation of tools that are not tied to a technical environment and constrained by standard graphical marks and layouts. We expect this method to better understand both current graphics and explore creative design spaces."
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We introduce DESCRIPT, a prototyping tool for infographics which captures strokes properties and interactions using a tree structure.
