abstract: Although multiple data authoring and visual representation creation tools have emerged over the last couple of years, they often favor either design or data. Multiple tools have tried to combine those two aspects, however, most of the link is manually done by the user (\eg data binding to graphical elements) which can inhibit their creative flow. We propose \tool, a tool aimed to assist the user in prototyping a visualization with the least amount of user input. After the drawing intention is captured by a free-hand sketching canvas an intermediate tree structure is generated, acting as a pivot between the representation and the data. By deriving a set of properties for each stroke in the canvas, \tool\ captures the implicit data of the strokes, and, combined to the hierarchy given by the tree structure, it generates a data table retrieved from the drawing. This data table can be used to simplify some tasks such as category binding using clustering methods over properties. Given the three components it is based on (\ie canvas, tree structure and data table), this tool enables a two-way workflow with forward interactions (representation to data) and backward interactions (augmentation of data to representation).  
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
