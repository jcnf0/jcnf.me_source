abstract: Although multiple data authoring and visual representation creation tools have emerged over the last couple of years, they often favor either design or data. Multiple tools have tried to combine those two aspects, however, most of the link is manually done by the user (e.g., data binding to graphical elements). We propose DESCRIPT, a tool aimed to assist the user in prototyping a visualization with the least amount of user input. After the drawing intention is captured by a free-hand sketching canvas, an intermediate tree structure is generated. This structure acts as a pivot between the representation and the data. As such, it enables a two-way workflow with forward interactions (representation to data) and backward interactions (augmentation of data to representation). 
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We introduce DESCRIPT, a prototyping tool for infographics which captures strokes properties and interactions using a tree structure.
